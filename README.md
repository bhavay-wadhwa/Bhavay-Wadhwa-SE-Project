## Overview

The **Real-Time Vehicle and Pedestrian Detection** system is designed to enhance **road safety** by detecting vehicles and pedestrians in real-time using advanced computer vision techniques. The system provides **accurate localization**, **distance estimation**, and **live alerts**, making it suitable for **in-vehicle** and **roadside deployment** scenarios.

This project contributes to intelligent transportation systems (ITS) and autonomous driving research by providing a **lightweight, deep learning-based detection pipeline** capable of operating on edge devices.

## Objectives

- Detect pedestrians and vehicles in **real time** from live camera feeds.  
- Estimate distances to detected objects using the **monocular pinhole camera model**.  
- Provide **warnings/alerts** based on proximity thresholds.  
- Maintain **lightweight deployment** suitable for embedded or low-power devices.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python, HTML, CSS 
- **Deep Learning Framework:** PyTorch, VGG16  
- **Model Architecture:** YOLOv9 (Ultralytics)  
- **Computer Vision Library:** OpenCV  
- **Tracking Algorithm:** Pinhole Camera, DeepSORT  
- **Web Framework:** Flask  
- **Dataset:** BDD100K / BDD10K (Berkeley DeepDrive)  
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, OpenCV

## System Workflow

1. **Input Feed:** Real-time video or dashcam stream.  
2. **Detection:** YOLOv9 model detects objects (person, car, bus, truck, bike, etc.).  
3. **Tracking:** DeepSORT maintains consistent identities across frames.  
4. **Distance Estimation:** Monocular pinhole model estimates object distance using bounding box width and camera parameters.  
5. **Alerts:** Distance-based thresholds generate warnings (for collision prevention).  
6. **Logging:** Events and detections are logged for later analysis.

## Implementation Details

- **YOLOv9 Fine-tuning:**  
  The model was fine-tuned using the **BDD10K dataset**, improving domain adaptation for road and urban scenes.  

- **Distance Estimation:**  
  Uses the formula:
  
  Distance = (Known Width × Focal Length) / Perceived Width
  
  This allows real-time distance approximation from single-camera input.  

- **Tracking:**  
  The DeepSORT algorithm provides temporal stability and consistent identification across video frames.
